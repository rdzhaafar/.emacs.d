1. This is my emacs config. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

2. My emacs config is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as
I must master my life.

3. My emacs config, without me, is useless. Without my emacs config, I am
useless.

4. My emacs config and I know that what counts in programming is not the 
amount of characters we type, the compile times, nor compiler warnings we 
get. We know that its working programs that count.

5. My emacs config is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will
learn it as a brother. I will learn its weakness, its strength, its parts,
its accessories, its sights and its lisp dialect. I will ever guard it against
the ravages of failing hard drives as I will ever guard my legs, my arms, my
eyes and my heart against damage. I will keep my emacs config short and to
the point. We will become part of each other.

6. Before God, I swear this creed. My emacs config and myself are the
masters of bugs. We are the saviours of my life.

7. So be it, until my code compiles without errors and there is nothing 
but working binaries.
